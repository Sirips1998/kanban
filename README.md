# Kanban Board Mini Project

## Overview
This is a **Kanban Board** web application built as a **Mini Project** to practice web development skills. It allows users to manage tasks using a simple drag-and-drop system, with four predefined columns:

- **Todo** (Tasks to be done)
- **Doing** (Tasks in progress)
- **Done** (Completed tasks)
- **Hold** (Tasks on hold)

## Features
- **Add Task Cards**: Users can create new task cards dynamically.
- **Remove Task Cards**: The last task in a random column can be deleted.
- **Drag and Drop**: Users can move tasks between columns.
- **Comment Box**: Each task card includes a textarea for adding comments.
- **Auto-Generated Tasks**: The board initializes with 10 random task cards.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** - Structure of the Kanban Board.
- **CSS** - Styling for a clean and simple UI.
- **JavaScript** - Handles drag-and-drop functionality and dynamic card management.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Click **Add Card** to create a new task.
3. Drag and drop cards between different columns.
4. Use the **Remove Card** button to delete the last card in a random column.

## Future Improvements
- **LocalStorage**: Save tasks so they persist after page refresh.
- **Edit Task Titles**: Allow users to rename tasks.
- **Improved UI**: Enhance design with animations and better styling.
